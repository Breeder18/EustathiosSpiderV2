Modifications Include:

Modified Zane Lightweight Carriage BLTouch

1. Opened up bushing holes to permit push fit into ABS with epoxy compound, rather than the standard acetone softening which has not worked very well for me personally.

2. Added a holes for 3mm filament strain relief.  I used glass-filled carbon fiber nylon from 3dxtech.  I had to heat up a few feet to straighten before using; however this is proved to be quite effective.

3. I modified the mounting for the BL touch, there are 2 versions
3a. Version that allows use of 3mm nuts - Note this has not been printed or tested yet.
3b. Version that has deeper holes for tapping of plastic for 3mm bolt.  I found that these holes were much too small for a heatset insert.  I ahve not tested this version either.

4. I added some fillets to the area just under the molex connector, this permits a little more clearance when isntalling molex connector.  Before adding this I was worried about breaking a wire while trying to install.
